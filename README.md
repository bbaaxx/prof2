# prof^2
## An ember-cli based app for managing and presenting your professional profile.

Profprof is the best name I could come with for this app because it manages professional profiles using an approach
that will enable an HR recruiter (like my girlfriend) to visualize all the aspects of a professional helping them identify one
or many functional roles for a given profile. This is particularly useful for professionals that qualify for many roles within an organization, something that is becoming more and more common these days, and is particularly true for IT professionals.
