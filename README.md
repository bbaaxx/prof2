## An ember-cli based app for managing and presenting your professional profile.

prof2 (short for *prof*essional *prof*iles) is an ember application to build, manage and present
information about your professional career. It's main objective is to allow the user to generate
views (resumes) of this information that can be easily consulted by recruiters and HR staff.

The aim of this app is to provide an intuitive guide to build a professional profile taking 
in consideration cases where a professional amasses a large collection of skills and experiences
that when combined into different skillsets and experiencesets will derive into the full range of possible
job roles for a given person.

An example of this would be the case of a developer that has experience with javascript development for
the frontend but also has experience and skills that can be used for an ITIL-CI position.
